A Score4 terminal game with AI that can be extended in many ways



This is my approach on an autonomous Score4 CLI game with AI implementation.

Specifically the features/concepts of this project are the following:
*	A pure C++ implementation that can be used as example and guide for various Board Game implementations
*	A simple yet powerful AI implementation of MinMax algorithm with A-B prunning with Monte Carlo heuristics
*	Implementation of a _game loop_ designed to run on the Main-Thread
*	Completely independent implementation of input and output interfaces, designed for easy integration with graphic engines
*	Designed for Object Oriented Programming tutoring
